***---Project Overview---***

This project involves predicting whether a patient has anemia based on a dataset. The dataset contains features such as Hemoglobin levels (Hb) and other medical indicators. The goal is to build a model that can predict the presence of anemia using Logistic Regression.


***---Dataset---***


Source: The dataset used is output.csv.

Target: The target variable is Anaemic, which indicates whether the patient is anemic.

Features: The dataset includes features like Sex, Hb (Hemoglobin levels), and other medical parameters.


***---Libraries Used---***


pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

numpy: Numerical computations

matplotlib: Data visualization

seaborn: Statistical data visualization

scikit-learn: Machine learning library (train-test split, logistic regression, confusion matrix, etc.)

***---Project Steps---***


***---Data Preprocessing:---***


Loaded the dataset.

Performed data exploration and handled categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Checked for duplicates and null values.


***---Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):---***


Visualized the relationship between Anaemic and Hb using bar plots and box plots.


***---Model Building:---***


Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Standardized the features using StandardScaler.

Built a logistic regression model to classify patients as anemic or non-anemic.


***---Model Evaluation:---***


Used a confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report to evaluate the model's performance.


***---How to Run the Project---***


Clone the repository from GitHub.

Install the required libraries:


pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Run the script in Google Colab or any Python IDE:


python anemia_prediction.py


***---Results---***


Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy score of X% (replace with actual accuracy).

Confusion Matrix: Provided insights into true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Classification Report: Detailed the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
